Abstract: "This study investigates a series of potential solutions for low-carbon power generation with hydrogen firing and carbon capture. Component and sub-system modeling is included in a multi-dimensional system model to assess effects on plant performance, size, and cost. Computational simulations are used to determine multi-stage machine performance across the power spectrum. The examined cycles include advanced dry-, wet-, bottoming-, oxyfuel cycles with air-separation units, and post-combustion carbon capture with exhaust gas recirculation. The results show a significant effect of different strategies on overall plant size and performance. They suggest that conventional combined-cycle plants are suitable for retrofits with hydrogen, but with added carbon-capture are not optimal when compared against other competing power generation solutions. Advanced gas-turbine cycles integrated with post-combustion carbon capture may offer more than 3\% better efficiency with a 70\% reduced physical footprint and 12\% lower CAPEX cost. The Allam cycle is another potential alternative for high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> capture but requires further optimization of oxygen production. Moreover, the properties of supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> disrupt the power-size curves. Control of leakage flows in the turbine was found to be critical below 100 MW, requiring very tight tip gaps and increased rotational speeds."
